# Game Design

My first foray into game design started with a class in high school. I don't remember what that class was called, but I remember it being one of my favorites. I still have my final project from that class, which is included in this repository. It is a simple game called Munch, where you are a small blob that gains mass by eating other blobs. Your goal is to become the biggest blob!

This game was made using Greenfoot, a program for learning java, created by Oracle and King's College.

My next foray into game design was much more recent. I was inspired by indie games to create my own game, so I spent the summer of 2023 learning everything I needed to create a 3D shooter game in Unity. While I never managed to make the game of my dreams, I did learn a huge amount about both game design and 3D modeling. Here are a few screenshots from test scenes and code I created in Unity.

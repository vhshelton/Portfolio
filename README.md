This is my portfolio, where I store the best of my creations! This is both a portfolio for professional use, and an archive for old projects.

# Game Design

My first foray into game design started with a class in high school. I don't remember what that class was called, but I remember it being one of my favorites. I still have my final project from that class, which is included in this repository. It is a simple game called Munch, where you are a small blob that gains mass by eating other blobs. Your goal is to become the biggest blob!

This game was made using Greenfoot, a program for learning java, created by Oracle and King's College. The whole project is available in the repository, if you want to take a closer look.

My next foray into game design was much more recent. I was inspired by indie games to create my own game, so I spent the summer of 2023 learning everything I needed to create a 3D shooter game in Unity. While I never managed to make the game of my dreams, I did learn a huge amount about both game design and 3D modeling. Here are a few screenshots from test scenes and code I created in Unity.

This is from Materialize, a program that generates image maps to make materials look more realistic.

# 2D Art

2D Art is what I have the most experience in. My favorite form is pixel art and sprites. I even have a little bit of experience animating sprites. A few examples can be found in the 2D Art folder, as well as here.

# 3D Art

My main experience in 3D art is in Blender and Blockbench. I have reached a reasonable proficiency in 3D modeling and texturing, as well as a bit in rigging.
